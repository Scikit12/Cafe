# Specialty Coffee Data Analysis with PySpark 

This project demonstrates practical data analysis using **PySpark** and **SQL** on a specialty coffee dataset.  
It covers the full workflow: data cleaning, schema inference, type conversion, and advanced SQL queriesâ€”all in a distributed environment.

## Dataset

The dataset contains 30 records of specialty coffees, with the following columns:

- `id`: Unique identifier
- `nombre_cafe`: Coffee name
- `origen`: Country of origin
- `proceso`: Processing method (e.g., Washed, Natural, Honey)
- `puntaje_sca`: SCA score (Specialty Coffee Association, 0-100)
